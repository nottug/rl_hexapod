# Hexapod robot

This is a project I've been working on for the past year that uses deep reinforcment learning (Actor Critic) to teach the hexapod how to walk. The goal is for the hexapod to follow a person using visual recognition. It runs off PyTorch and uses [YOLO](https://github.com/longcw/yolo2-pytorch) for the object recognition and some of the code was taken from an [A3C implementation](https://github.com/longcw/yolo2-pytorch).
